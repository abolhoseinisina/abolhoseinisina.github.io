Annealing metal?,https://www.win-therm.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/annealing-metal-01.jpeg,"When you increase the temperature of a material, its molecules can freely move and get new positions. Then, when it cools down slowly, molecules positions are stabilized and the material can tolerate more pressure. It's due to the fact that the molecules have better formation. A researcher asked themselves, can we use this characteristic in solving hard problems? And after a while, they found the answer and the answer was a big YES. So, the basic idea is that, in the early stages of searching the solutions space, we may accept a bad solution instead of a good one that we found, and explore around the bad one. As we get to the final stages of our search, the probability of choosing bad solutions gets lower and we get more eager to explore around the good solutions we find. That's the idea, and then they implemented it in several languages and named it 'Simulated Annealing'. I have recently tried to implement the algorithm in MATLAB (I know, but I had to :\) to solve TSP problems.

The geographical attributes may be area, topography, demography, climate, natural resources or even applied science. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) believed a country that has commercial and military control over the sea is powerful. That's why gaining control over choke points, canals, and coaling stations is very important. Mahan counted six conditions to have sea power: <ul><li>Advantageous geographical position</li><li>Serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate</li><li>Extent of territory</li><li>Population large enough to defend its territory</li><li>Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea</li></ul> Mahan believed that in central Asia there are still independent countries that survived, such as Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, and Japan. <br /> Nicholas J. Spykman believed that resources and population of Eurasia are far more than America. This can be extremely dangerous for America if one power rules one of the spheres of Europe or Asia. So America must seek a balance between powers in Eurasia. The beginning of the Cold War had two aspects, first, moral opposition to Communism and second, the geopolitical task of containing Soviet expansion, Kissinger said. America was the winner of the Cold War because it was for the first time that a non-Eurasian power balanced the powers in it.  <br />Why not watch this movie to get a better insight with maps? <iframe width='100%' height='300' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZJFozFsnIU' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

The police office asks you about the location of the accident. But you are unaware of the coordinates. Another way to answer this question, is to tell the officer what the name of the highway is and how much you drove from a specific city toward which direction. For example, you can tell them, I drove 20 miles to the west of Winnipeg on Highway 1. This description lets the officers know your exact location. This is the basis of Linear Referencing Systems.<div>Linear referencing is the method to store and geographically locate data using relative positions along a measured line feature without the need to explicitly use x, y coordinates or an address (<a href='https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/linear-referencing/introduction-to-linear-referencing.htm' target='_blank'>ESRI</a>).

That's why Saudi Arabia has to rely on the World marine superpower (U.S.) to secure its ships. With the improvements in energy, the U.S. has become less dependent on Saudi Arabia's oil. So, Saudi Arabia may not be able to offer anything to the U.S. in the future for collaboration. That's why Mohammed Bin Salman purchased lots of weapons from western countries.

The most important issue for Japan is it decline in the population. The fertility rate in Japan has been very serious in recent years. 'Japan’s birth rate may be falling because there are fewer good opportunities for young people, and especially men, in the country’s economy' says The Atlantic (Link). Also, lack of natural resources is another important issue in Japan. There are a lot of high-tech industries in Japan that are in need of natural resources. Japan has to import them from abroad and it all goes through the sea. Natural resources are not even enough to provide food and energy for the population. This is why Japan is very dependent on maritime transportation. Providing security is beyond the Japanese navy. So, they mostly rely on the navy superpower (i.e. the United States) to provide the security of maritime transportation for the Japanese maritime transportation. As a result, Japan has to stay valuable for the U.S., and that's why they support the strength of the U.S. dollar and its conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although Japan is after independence in Navy and Army forces, it is a gradual process and it takes time.</div></div><div><br></div><br><div class='image-container w3-center'><img src='https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ukqC1XtoZS3cwX9t-4zBt4w1HKs=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6386907/Screen_Shot_2016-04-25_at_2.50.29_PM.0.png' width='80%'><div class='image-overlay'>Reference: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com</div><br></div><div><div>The relationship between Japan and China is also vital for Japan.

It is a key indicator of the sustainability of government finance. A low debt to GDP ratio is always preferable because it means a country is producing and selling goods and has sufficient ability to pay back its debt by taking any further debt. As the debt to gross domestic product ratio for a country rises, the risk of the country becoming default also rises. So, Japan has to produce more in order to reduce this ratio.

It is actually a successor of S programming language and the first version was released in February 2000. It is well-known for its vast community and it&nbsp;is one of the most commonly used programming languages used in data mining. it is an open-source free software environment within the GNU package.<div>What is <i>GNU package</i>?&nbsp;</div><div>There are nine aspects which generally apply to being a GNU package (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_packages' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>):<br></div><div><div><ul><li>The package should say that it is a GNU package.</li><li>It should be distributed via ftp.gnu.org, or another site offering access to everyone.</li><li>The package's homepage should be on the GNU website.</li><li>The developers must pay attention to making their software work well with other GNU packages.</li><li>Documentation should be in Texinfo format, or in a format easily convertible to Texinfo.</li><li>Should use GNU Guile for its extension language, but exceptions are explicitly possible in this regard.</li><li>Should not recommend any non-free program, nor refer the user to any non-free documentation or non-free software.</li><li>Use GNU terminology, including referring to GNU/Linux systems and free software in situations where other observers would write Linux and open source.</li><li>The maintainer should be contactable, at least infrequently, to discuss problems in the software or fixing compatibility issues.</li></ul><div>It is written primarily in&nbsp;<u>C</u>,&nbsp;<u>Fortran</u>, and&nbsp;<u>R</u>&nbsp;itself (partially self-hosting). How? On way is to start building <u>R</u> with <u>C</u> or <u>Fortran</u>, then when <u>R</u> reaches a point that can be used to build other sections of itself, it can be transferred to the&nbsp;<u>R</u> environment.</div></div></div><div>R has a command line interface. Multiple third-party graphical user interfaces are also available, such as RStudio.<br></div><div>R's data structures include vectors, arrays, lists, and data frames.&nbsp;R supports array arithmetic and it has the capabilities that MATLAB has with matrices. R has no scalar data type, they are represented as length-1 vectors. C, C++, and Fortran code can be linked to R scripts for better performance.</div></div><div>R supports procedural programming with functions and object-oriented programming with generic functions.&nbsp;Functions are <i>first-class</i> objects and can be manipulated in the same way as data objects, facilitating <i>meta-programming</i> that allows <i>multiple dispatch</i>.<br></div><div>What is <i>First-Class functions</i>?</div><div>In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens. This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.<br></div><div>What is <i>Meta-programming</i>?</div><div>It is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.<br></div><div>What is&nbsp;<i>Multiple dispatch</i>?</div><div>It is a feature of some programming languages in which a function or method can be dynamically dispatched based on the run-time type or, in the more general case, some other attribute of more than one of its arguments. Function arguments are passed by value, and are <i>lazy</i>. <i>Lazy</i>? It means, they are only evaluated when they are used, not when the function is called.&nbsp;While R is specifically designed for doing statistical analysis, Python is a general-purpose programming language.&nbsp;R's capabilities are extended through user-created packages, which offer statistical techniques, graphical devices, import/export, reporting (RMarkdown, knitr, Sweave), etc. These packages and their easy installation and use has been cited as driving the language's widespread adoption in data science.</div><div>Let's watch a tutorial to learn the basics:</div><div><iframe width='100%' height='300' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_V8eKsto3Ug' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share' allowfullscreen></iframe><br></div>"

I have noticed that there are a range of machine learning approaches to do such task. Ordinary machine learning approaches do not consider the spatial dimension of data. However, there is an approach in Geo-spatial analysis which is based on statistical machine learning algorithms and also considers the spatiality of data. Let's scratch the surface of this algorithm.</div><div>Using geo-statistical techniques, you can create surfaces incorporating the statistical properties of the measured data.&nbsp;Because geo-statistics is based on statistics, these techniques produce not only prediction surfaces but also error or <b>uncertainty surfaces</b>, giving you an indication of how good the predictions are. It is very important capability.&nbsp;They can also produce probability and quantile output maps depending on your needs. This information is vital to understand the data.</div><div>Many methods are associated with geo-statistics, but they are all in the kriging family,&nbsp;ordinary, simple, universal, probability, indicator, and disjunctive kriging, along with their counterparts in co-kriging. Kriging is divided into two distinct tasks: quantifying the spatial structure of the data and producing a prediction. Quantifying the structure, known as <b>variography</b>, is where you fit a spatial-dependence model to your data. To make a prediction for an unknown value for a specific location, kriging will use the fitted model from <b>variography</b>, the spatial data configuration, and the values of the measured sample points around the prediction location.<br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Ordinary Kriging</b><br></div><div><div style=''>Ordinary kriging assumes the model</div><div style=''><b>Z(s) = µ + ε(s),</b></div><div style=''>where µ is an unknown constant. µ(s) = m for all locations s, and if µ is unknown, this is the model on which ordinary kriging is based. It can also be composed of a linear function of the spatial coordinates themselves, for example:</div><div><b>µ(s) = ß0 + ß1x + ß2y + ß3x2 + ß4y2 + ß5xy,</b></div></div><div style=''>Ordinary kriging assumes an unknown constant mean.&nbsp;The data points need to be sampled from a phenomenon that is continuous in space.

But you know that interpolation the target variable is not independent of other variables. Sometimes, collecting data for the target variable is expensive. But you know that it has a high correlation with other variables that are cheaper to collect. So, what you actually want to do is to consider two or more related variable simultaneously in interpolating your target variables. Co-Kriging is one of the well-known algorithms that lets you do this kind of interpolations.<br></div></div><div>Cokriging uses information on several variable types. The main variable of interest is Z1, and both autocorrelation for Z1 and cross-correlations between Z1 and all other variable types are used to make better predictions. rdinary cokriging assumes the following two models:</div><div><b>Z1(s) = µ1 + ε1(s)</b></div><div><b>Z2(s) = µ2 + ε2(s),</b></div><div>where µ1 and µ2 are unknown constants.</div><div>For example, consider the following image:</div><br><div class='image-container w3-center'><img src='https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.6/extensions/geostatistical-analyst/GUID-7800F41B-3F5B-4EC2-B43C-B364876714F5-web.jpg' width='70%'><div class='image-overlay'>Reference: https://desktop.arcgis.com</div><br></div><div>Z1 and Z2 both appear autocorrelated.

In this example, each location s had both Z1(s) and Z2(s); however, this is not necessary, and each variable type can have its own unique set of locations.<br></div><div><i>Autocorrelation?</i>&nbsp;</div><div>The correlation or similarity of values, generally values that are nearby in a dataset. Temporal data is said to exhibit serial autocorrelation when values measured close together in time are more similar than values measured far apart in time.

Writing in the Telegraph, Bettany Hughes praised it as a 'charismatic and essential book', while Anthony Sattin, writing in The Guardian, called it 'ambitious' and 'full of insight but let down by factual errors'. Frankopan's follow-up book, <i>The New Silk Roads: The Present and Future of the World</i> was published in 2018.<br><div class='image-container w3-center'><img src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1vC6rVEgOL.jpg' width='50%'><div class='image-overlay'>Reference: https://m.media-amazon.com</div><br></div><div>The conventional belief is that Western civilization started with the Romans, who in turn were born from the Greeks, who, according to some historians, were inherited from the Egyptians. Frankopan claims that the rise of Western culture was actually rooted on the Persian Empire. He believes that the cradle of civilization is ancient Persia.</div><div><div>The Persian Empire was one of the greatest in history. It stretched from Egypt and Greece to India, and it was built on trade between its cities. The Persians had a network of roads that connected the Mediterranean to the heart of Asia. The roads were a great achievement, but they were just part of the Silk Roads. The Silk Roads eventually became a network that connected China to the West.</div><div>China expanded its borders in 206 BCE and 220 CE. It pushed them northward and westward as far as the Eurasian steppes, which cover much of modern-day Russia’s southern regions. This expansion linked Persia’s trade routes with China’s own network of roads.</div></div><div>The Silk Road facilitated the exchange of not only goods, but also ideas. Religious ideas were the most powerful in this period. Local cults mixed with established beliefs, creating a rich melting pot of religious thought. For instance, Greek gods spread to other areas while Buddhism came from India into China and Asia.&nbsp;Early Christianity was able to spread quickly because of its ability to network. Moreover, It is now widely thought that the route was one of the main ways that plague bacteria responsible for the Black Death pandemic in Europe in the mid-14th century moved westward from Asia.<br></div><div>With the gradual loss of Roman territory in Asia and the rise of Arabian power in the Levant, the Silk Road became increasingly unsafe and untraveled. In the 13th and 14th centuries the route was revived under the Mongols, and at that time the Venetian Marco Polo used it to travel to Cathay (China).<br></div>"

18,computers,2023-05-18,09:49,Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF,Install COG extension on Geoserver,https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sz6u8gwcmddbnf6i9i18.png,"A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file, aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud. It does this by leveraging the ability of clients issuing ​HTTP GET range requests to ask for just the parts of a file they need. [<a href='https://www.cogeo.org/' target='_blank'>Link</a>]<div>Before COGs, we used to create services for GeoTIFFs and then build pyramids (or overviews) for them in order to get a quicker response for users based on their zoom level. Each level of pyramid had a certain level of detail. In COGs, this is a built-in capability. The pyramids (we call it overviews in COGs) are stored inside a COG. The second exciting built-in ability&nbsp;is the tiling scheme inside a COG. This helps us to load only the portion of the GeoTIFF that a user requested for based on the bounding box. So, if you have a huge COG (even I have seen COGs larger than 50 GB), you are not required to first load a whole overview and then crop a requested bbox.</div><div>Geoserver has a community extension for COGs that works well. In order to install it on your Geoserver, you can use the following commands. These commands are the same if you are following my last post and you have installed your Geoserver on an AWS EC2 instance:</div><div>1. Click on 'connect' button to get SSH access to your instance.

Our Tomcat server is running on Ubuntu. So, we followed the steps below to enable SSL connections on our server:<div>1. First of all, you have to set the inbound rules of your EC2 instance that has your Tomcat server and Geoserver. Add a custom TCP connection of IPv4 and IPv6 and port number 8443.</div><div>2. Navigate to <i>cd /var/lib/tomcat9/conf</i> and use Keytool to create a new Keystore:</div><div><i>keytool -genkey -alias <b>server </b>-keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore <b>your_site_name</b>.jks</i><br></div><div>3.&nbsp;Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from your New Keystore:</div><div><i>keytool -certreq -alias server -file csr.txt -keystore your_site_name.jks</i><br></div><div>4.

I am trying to publish these COGs as GeoTiff layers using COG extension in Geoserver. The Geoserver is deployed on an EC2 instance with 8 vCPUs and 16Gb of RAM. The projection system of COGs is WGS84 (EPSG:4326) and access the WMS endpoints in WGS84.</div><div></div><div>I realized that the first thing Geoserver does, is to load the header of a COG and then access its inner tiles. By default, Geoserver reads the first 16KB of COGs to access the header. If the COG is too large, then it repeats sending requests for the rest of the header and each time only reads 16KB of data.&nbsp;</div><div>I have overridden this parameter to tell Geoserver read a larger portion of data when it wants to read headers:&nbsp;</div><div><code style='color: #970000'>it.geosolutions.cog.default.header.length</code>&nbsp;</div><div>To set this system property,&nbsp; I place the line below in<code style='color: #970000'> /var/lib/tomcat9/conf/catalina.properties</code>:</div><div><code style='color: #970000'>it.geosolutions.cog.default.header.length=262144&nbsp;</code></div><div>This number is in bytes, so it is equal to 256KB.

In my recent research I am trying to find a spatial relationship between points on a map, that were not clustered based on their spatial attributes. So, I want to find an answer to these question:<div><ul><li>Is there a spatial relationship among and between these clusters?</li><li>What spatial features are involved in their likelihood?</li></ul><div>To find these answers, first I had to come up with some spatial features such as, distance from city centers, distance from main roads, etc. Then I had to do some kind of feature selection, because there were two many features. That way I could tell which ones are the effective ones. And finally, I had to decide between different classification algorithms. By the way, each model has different parameters to tune.</div></div><div>After a lot of experiments, I came up with a flowchart for myself to find the best possible model and features to create my classifier. I brought a pseudo-code for you so that you can write it in Python or R.</div><div><br></div><div><div><code style='color: rgb(151, 0, 0);'>X, y = read_data() &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</code></div><div><code style='color: rgb(151, 0, 0);'>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(X, y, test_size=0.2) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</code></div><div><code style='color: rgb(151, 0, 0);'>X_train, X_test = remove_highly_correalted_features(X_train, X_test) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</code></div><div><code style='color: rgb(151, 0, 0);'>tuned_random_forest = tune_random_forest_classifier(X_train, y_train) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</code></div><div><code style='color: rgb(151, 0, 0);'>X_train, X_test = feature_selection(tuned_rf, X_train, y_train, X_test)</code></div><div><code style='color: rgb(151, 0, 0);'>calculate_feature_importance(tuned_rf, X_train, y_train)&nbsp;</code></div><div><code style='color: rgb(151, 0, 0);'>compare_classifiers(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)</code></div></div><div><br></div><div>In this procedure, you have to be careful that you must not include your test data in finding highly correlated data, tuning classifier for your feature selector, feature selection, and calculating feature importance. Keep it until the end, when you want to compare the results of different classifiers. If you cross-validation score is high, and your test score is low, then it means you are over-fitting. If your cross-validation score is low, and your test score is low, then you are under-fitting.</div>"
