Annealing metal?,https://www.win-therm.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/annealing-metal-01.jpeg,"When you increase the temperature of a material, its molecules can freely move and get new positions. Then, when it cools down slowly, molecules positions are stabilized and the material can tolerate more pressure. It's due to the fact that the molecules have better formation. A researcher asked themselves, can we use this characteristic in solving hard problems? And after a while, they found the answer and the answer was a big YES. So, the basic idea is that, in the early stages of searching the solutions space, we may accept a bad solution instead of a good one that we found, and explore around the bad one. As we get to the final stages of our search, the probability of choosing bad solutions gets lower and we get more eager to explore around the good solutions we find. That's the idea, and then they implemented it in several languages and named it 'Simulated Annealing'. I have recently tried to implement the algorithm in MATLAB (I know, but I had to :\) to solve TSP problems.

The geographical attributes may be area, topography, demography, climate, natural resources or even applied science. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914) believed a country that has commercial and military control over the sea is powerful. That's why gaining control over choke points, canals, and coaling stations is very important. Mahan counted six conditions to have sea power: <ul><li>Advantageous geographical position</li><li>Serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate</li><li>Extent of territory</li><li>Population large enough to defend its territory</li><li>Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea</li></ul> Mahan believed that in central Asia there are still independent countries that survived, such as Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, and Japan. <br /> Nicholas J. Spykman believed that resources and population of Eurasia are far more than America. This can be extremely dangerous for America if one power rules one of the spheres of Europe or Asia. So America must seek a balance between powers in Eurasia. The beginning of the Cold War had two aspects, first, moral opposition to Communism and second, the geopolitical task of containing Soviet expansion, Kissinger said. America was the winner of the Cold War because it was for the first time that a non-Eurasian power balanced the powers in it.  "
