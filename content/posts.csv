Annealing metal?,https://www.win-therm.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/annealing-metal-01.jpeg,"When you increase the temperature of a material, its molecules can freely move and get new positions. Then, when it cools down slowly, molecules positions are stabilized and the material can tolerate more pressure. It's due to the fact that the molecules have better formation. A researcher asked themselves, can we use this characteristic in solving hard problems? And after a while, they found the answer and the answer was a big YES. So, the basic idea is that, in the early stages of searching the solutions space, we may accept a bad solution instead of a good one that we found, and explore around the bad one. As we get to the final stages of our search, the probability of choosing bad solutions gets lower and we get more eager to explore around the good solutions we find. That's the idea, and then they implemented it in several languages and named it 'Simulated Annealing'. I have recently tried to implement the algorithm in MATLAB (I know, but I had to :\) to solve TSP problems.

The geographical attributes may be area, topography, demography, climate, natural resources or even applied science. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) believed a country that has commercial and military control over the sea is powerful. That's why gaining control over choke points, canals, and coaling stations is very important. Mahan counted six conditions to have sea power: <ul><li>Advantageous geographical position</li><li>Serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate</li><li>Extent of territory</li><li>Population large enough to defend its territory</li><li>Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea</li></ul> Mahan believed that in central Asia there are still independent countries that survived, such as Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, and Japan. <br /> Nicholas J. Spykman believed that resources and population of Eurasia are far more than America. This can be extremely dangerous for America if one power rules one of the spheres of Europe or Asia. So America must seek a balance between powers in Eurasia. The beginning of the Cold War had two aspects, first, moral opposition to Communism and second, the geopolitical task of containing Soviet expansion, Kissinger said. America was the winner of the Cold War because it was for the first time that a non-Eurasian power balanced the powers in it.  <br />Why not watch this movie to get a better insight with maps? <iframe width='100%' height='300' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZJFozFsnIU' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

The police office asks you about the location of the accident. But you are unaware of the coordinates. Another way to answer this question, is to tell the officer what the name of the highway is and how much you drove from a specific city toward which direction. For example, you can tell them, I drove 20 miles to the west of Winnipeg on Highway 1. This description lets the officers know your exact location. This is the basis of Linear Referencing Systems.<div>Linear referencing is the method to store and geographically locate data using relative positions along a measured line feature without the need to explicitly use x, y coordinates or an address (<a href='https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/linear-referencing/introduction-to-linear-referencing.htm' target='_blank'>ESRI</a>). We can define a point or part of a line along a linear feature in this referencing system. LRSs can be generated for different tasks along a same linear feature.

That's why Saudi Arabia has to rely on the World marine superpower (U.S.) to secure its ships. With the improvements in energy, the U.S. has become less dependent on Saudi Arabia's oil. So, Saudi Arabia may not be able to offer anything to the U.S. in the future for collaboration. That's why Mohammed Bin Salman purchased lots of weapons from western countries.

The most important issue for Japan is it declination in population. The fertility rate in Japan is very serious in the recent years. 'Japan’s birth rate may be falling because there are fewer good opportunities for young people, and especially men, in the country’s economy' says The Atlantic (Link). Also, lack of natural resources is another important issue in Japan. There are a lot of high-tech industries in Japan that are in need of natural resources. Japan has to import them from abroad and it all goes through the Sea. Natural resources are not even enough to provide food and energy for the population. This is why Japan is very dependent to maritime transportation. Providing security is beyond Japanese navy. So, they mostly rely on the navy superpower (i.e. the United States) to provide the security of maritime transportation for Japanese maritime transportation. As a result, Japan has to stay valuable for the U.S., and that's why they support the strength of U.S. dollar and U.S. conflicts in the Afghanistan and Iraq. Although Japan is after independence in Navy and Army forces, it is a gradual process and it takes time.</div></div><div><br></div><br><div class='image-container w3-center'><img src='https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ukqC1XtoZS3cwX9t-4zBt4w1HKs=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6386907/Screen_Shot_2016-04-25_at_2.50.29_PM.0.png' width='80%'><div class='image-overlay'>Reference: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com</div><br></div><div><div>The relationship between Japan and China is also vital for Japan.
