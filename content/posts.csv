Annealing metal?,https://www.win-therm.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/annealing-metal-01.jpeg,"When you increase the temperature of a material, its molecules can freely move and get new positions. Then, when it cools down slowly, molecules positions are stabilized and the material can tolerate more pressure. It's due to the fact that the molecules have better formation. A researcher asked themselves, can we use this characteristic in solving hard problems? And after a while, they found the answer and the answer was a big YES. So, the basic idea is that, in the early stages of searching the solutions space, we may accept a bad solution instead of a good one that we found, and explore around the bad one. As we get to the final stages of our search, the probability of choosing bad solutions gets lower and we get more eager to explore around the good solutions we find. That's the idea, and then they implemented it in several languages and named it 'Simulated Annealing'. I have recently tried to implement the algorithm in MATLAB (I know, but I had to. :\) to solve TSP problems.
