Annealing metal?,https://www.win-therm.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/annealing-metal-01.jpeg,"When you increase the temperature of a material, its molecules can freely move and get new positions. Then, when it cools down slowly, molecules positions are stabilized and the material can tolerate more pressure. It's due to the fact that the molecules have better formation. A researcher asked themselves, can we use this characteristic in solving hard problems? And after a while, they found the answer and the answer was a big YES. So, the basic idea is that, in the early stages of searching the solutions space, we may accept a bad solution instead of a good one that we found, and explore around the bad one. As we get to the final stages of our search, the probability of choosing bad solutions gets lower and we get more eager to explore around the good solutions we find. That's the idea, and then they implemented it in several languages and named it 'Simulated Annealing'. I have recently tried to implement the algorithm in MATLAB (I know, but I had to :\) to solve TSP problems.

The geographical attributes may be area, topography, demography, climate, natural resources or even applied science. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) believed a country that has commercial and military control over the sea is powerful. That's why gaining control over choke points, canals, and coaling stations is very important. Mahan counted six conditions to have sea power: <ul><li>Advantageous geographical position</li><li>Serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate</li><li>Extent of territory</li><li>Population large enough to defend its territory</li><li>Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea</li></ul> Mahan believed that in central Asia there are still independent countries that survived, such as Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, and Japan. <br /> Nicholas J. Spykman believed that resources and population of Eurasia are far more than America. This can be extremely dangerous for America if one power rules one of the spheres of Europe or Asia. So America must seek a balance between powers in Eurasia. The beginning of the Cold War had two aspects, first, moral opposition to Communism and second, the geopolitical task of containing Soviet expansion, Kissinger said. America was the winner of the Cold War because it was for the first time that a non-Eurasian power balanced the powers in it.  <br />Why not watch this movie to get a better insight with maps? <iframe width='100%' height='300' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZJFozFsnIU' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

Somehow I found it very interesting how the geography shaped the Canada population, economic and policies. There are two major geographical features in Canada, The Canadian Shield and the Rocky mountains range. The first one shaped the population growth in Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. There is no possibility for agricultural or infrastrutural growth in the sheild region. So, it has stayed inhabitable. It also created a gap between the Ontario and eastern provinces and the praries (which consists of Alberta, Saskatchuan and Manitoba). This gap has bring differences in culture, infrastructure, population and also other features of the society. There is also the Rocky mountain range in the west of praries. This high altitude mountain, has made a barrier between other parts of the Canada and the British Columbia province. It's fascinating how Canada stayed unified during all these years with these gaps in between the country. The praries region has more connection with the Canada's southern neighbor because there is no barrier in the southern parts of Canada. Most of the population has been concentrated in the east coast. so, there is a lack of good transportation infrastructure between eastern regions and the rest of Canada.

He concluded that static states are in decline. He was also agreed that sea power is needed because of its advantages. After Ratzek, several scientists expanded his theories and there were used in the propaganda of Nazi Germany. After this, German geopolitic was discredited.<br /> Germany is located in the center of Europe with 7 navigable rivers. South of Germany is the Alpe mountains and north of it is the Baltic Sear. The rivers provide cheap tranpsrotation of goods and materials along their path and that's one of the main reasons Germany is the 3rd exporter in the World. This has brung with itself wealth for Germany government. The power in Germany is decentralized over the country. This is how Germany has been keeping its unity. But the wealth is not dispersed evenly, specially between west and east of the country, maybe due to their past. but 100% due to the rivers layout.<br />South of Germany is geographically have advantages, but north of it is a flat land that can be envaded from every direction. That's where EU and NATO come t help Germany with its borders in east and west, respectively.<br />Let's look at the map: <iframe width='100%' height='300' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTPIzzcBPaA' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

So, they have been in a close relationship with the U.S. They have participated in several conflicts in support of the U.S. (29 conflicts in all continents). Currently, they act as a bridge between the U.S. and Europe. The U.K. must make sure that a power or unity does not occur in Europe.

Iran is a <b>fortress</b>. Borders of Iran are limited to the mountain ranges surrounding it in West, East and North and the Persian Gulf limiting it from the South. Iran has been known for its oil.

That's just like the conflicts the U.S. and the Soviet Union had between 1947 and 1991. Iran and Saudi Arabia are fighting for control over the Middle East. Super powers like U.S., British Empire and Russia have always intervened in Iran affair. Even, the U.S. performed a coup in 1953, against Mossadegh and killed the possibility of a democracy in Iran. After the Islamic revolution of Iran in 1972, Iran tried to get more control over the Middle East countries. After Iraq invasion to Iran, the Saudi Arabia supported Iraq.
