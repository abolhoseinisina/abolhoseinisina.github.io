Annealing metal?,https://www.win-therm.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/annealing-metal-01.jpeg,"When you increase the temperature of a material, its molecules can freely move and get new positions. Then, when it cools down slowly, molecules positions are stabilized and the material can tolerate more pressure. It's due to the fact that the molecules have better formation. A researcher asked themselves, can we use this characteristic in solving hard problems? And after a while, they found the answer and the answer was a big YES. So, the basic idea is that, in the early stages of searching the solutions space, we may accept a bad solution instead of a good one that we found, and explore around the bad one. As we get to the final stages of our search, the probability of choosing bad solutions gets lower and we get more eager to explore around the good solutions we find. That's the idea, and then they implemented it in several languages and named it 'Simulated Annealing'. I have recently tried to implement the algorithm in MATLAB (I know, but I had to :\) to solve TSP problems. Take a look and enjoy. <a href='https://github.com/abolhoseinisina/GIS-Tools/tree/main/Computational%20Intelligence/TSP/Simulated%20Annealing'>Link</a> <br> Also, take a look at this video for better understanding: <br> <iframe width='100%' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaq_Fpr4KZc' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

The geographical attributes may be area, topography, demography, climate, natural resources or even applied science. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) believed a country that has commercial and military control over the sea is powerful. That's why gaining control over choke points, canals, and coaling stations is very important. Mahan counted six conditions to have sea power: <ul><li>Advantageous geographical position</li><li>Serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate</li><li>Extent of territory</li><li>Population large enough to defend its territory</li><li>Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea</li></ul> Mahan believed that in central Asia there are still independent countries that survived, such as Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, and Japan. <br /> Nicholas J. Spykman believed that resources and population of Eurasia are far more than America. This can be extremely dangerous for America if one power rules one of the spheres of Europe or Asia. So America must seek a balance between powers in Eurasia. The beginning of the Cold War had two aspects, first, moral opposition to Communism and second, the geopolitical task of containing Soviet expansion, Kissinger said. America was the winner of the Cold War because it was for the first time that a non-Eurasian power balanced the powers in it.  <br />Why not watch this movie to get a better insight with maps? <iframe width='100%' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZJFozFsnIU' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

That's why Taiwan is absolutely important to China. After stabilizing its economy, China wants to play a more important role in global affairs. China initiated the One Belt One Road project to achieve this objective. By having access to the ocean, having better access to Central and West Asia can increase its power exponentially. <br /><img src='https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/stratfor/files/2017/10/q3-asia-belt-and-road-main-map-obor-white-1-1200x1207.jpg?height=715&width=711&fit=bounds' width='100%'/><br /> The communism idealogy seems to be not blaring the vision of politicians in China. They are collaborating with liberal countries to move toward their goals. The Belt Road Initiative is an ambitious project to achieve oil and gas in the Middle East. It should be noted that China has also created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to compete with the World Bank. Currently, Cybersecurity and Social Media apps play important roles in the relation between China and the U.S. and tension between them may arise based on these two issues. There have been large censorships in China towards U.S. Social Media apps. Until now, China has challenged none of Russian interests in Central Asia.
